## Define a cause

### What kind of event is happening?
<!-- Write down what kind of event you are facing -->
-

### Expected outcome
<!-- What is the outcome you are expecting -->
-

## Find the true cause: Collect data and evidence

### Datetime of the event stared
<!-- When the event started? -->
<!-- e.g. Datetime of error message, or the time when system performance started to decrease, or when you catch a call from a user -->

### Environment
<!-- Where or which environment did the event occur, or where it doen't occur -->
<!-- e.g. available zone, network, development or production, ... -->

### Related events
<!-- Is there any events that kicked around the datetime? -->
-

### Hypothesis and measured data (Facts)
<!-- List up any reason that relates to the event as hypothesises. Then repeat collecting data to verify whether each hypothesises are valid or not. -->
<!-- Make sure data are collected objectively and don't beleave in your intuition.   -->
<!-- Sometime it need to make some monitoring system and scripts to collect facts. e.g. custom prometheus exporter, or cron script to collect data, ... -->

#### Hypothesis
<!-- List up causes that might be the true cause -->
- [ ]

#### Measured data (Facts)
<!-- List down data when the issue occured -->
<!-- Check that above hypothesises are accepted or rejected by collected data.  -->

<!-- Do you collect enough data or time for evaluating hypothesises? -->

## What made the true cause?

### Measures to prevent recurrence
<!-- What kind of system or operation are needed to stop the true cause occurs ? -->
<!-- Ask yourself repeatedly that those measures  are really effective to prevent recurrence. -->
